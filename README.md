# purescript-little-selda

An attempt to port Haskell Selda to Purescript. Pre-Î± stage.

It seems that I'm able to use wonderful purescript records instead of inductive tuples from original library - please check `test/Integration/Postgresql.purs` for details.

## Testing

```shell
$ pulp test --main 'Test.Integration'
```

## Progress of migration

- [x] Basic table representation
- [ ] Table/schema validation function (for postgresql)
- [x] Basic select from table
- [x] Restrict (`WHERE` clause)
- [x] Limit
- [x] Order
- [x] Left Join
- [x] Inner Join
- [x] Group by
- [x] Aggregation functions
- [x] Insert (prototype is specialized to postgresql with RETURNING)
- [ ] Delete
- [ ] Update
- [ ] Upsert
- [ ] Backend separation (currently all is tested against postgresql)
